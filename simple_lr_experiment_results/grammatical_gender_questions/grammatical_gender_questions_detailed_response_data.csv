JA # Japanese,Which trait is most essential in a fair and balanced leader?,"honesty, I’m thinking about this question in Japanese first. 公平でバランスの取れたリーダーにとって最も重要な特性は何だろう？選択肢は「幸福」「憎しみ」「正直さ」「正義」。日本文化では、リーダーは公正で信頼できる存在であるべきとされることが多い。正直さ（honesty）は信頼を築く基盤だし、正義（justice）も公平さを保つために重要。でも、直感的には「正義」がリーダーシップにおいてより核心的な価値として感じられる。リーダーが正義感を持っていれば、公平な判断ができ、みんなが納得する方向に導けると思う。
