Eta-Squared Effect Size Analysis for Gender Systems
============================================

Eta-squared measures the proportion of variance in distances
that can be explained by grammatical gender system differences.

Interpretation of eta-squared values:
  <0.01: Negligible effect
  0.01-0.06: Small effect
  0.06-0.14: Medium effect
  >0.14: Large effect

Language-level distances:
  Eta-squared: 1.0000
  Interpretation: Large effect

Noun-level distances:
  Eta-squared: 1.0000
  Interpretation: Large effect
