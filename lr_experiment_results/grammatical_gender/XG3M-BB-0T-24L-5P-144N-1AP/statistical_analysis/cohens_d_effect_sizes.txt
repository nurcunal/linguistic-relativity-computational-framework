Cohen's d Effect Size Analysis for Grammatical Gender Systems
======================================================

Cohen's d measures the standardized difference between two means.
It quantifies how much gender systems differ in their semantic distances.

Interpretation of Cohen's d values:
  <0.2: Negligible effect
  0.2-0.5: Small effect
  0.5-0.8: Medium effect
  >0.8: Large effect

Results sorted by effect size magnitude (largest first):

Minimal-Gendered vs. Tri-Gendered:
  Cohen's d: 2.3906 (Large effect)
  Cross-system mean distance: 0.0779 (n=5)

  Difference: 0.0479

Fully Non-Gendered vs. Minimal-Gendered:
  Cohen's d: 2.3239 (Large effect)
  Cross-system mean distance: 0.0828 (n=7)
