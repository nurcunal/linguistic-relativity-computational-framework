Cohen's d Effect Size Analysis for Grammatical Gender Systems
======================================================

Cohen's d measures the standardized difference between two means.
It quantifies how much gender systems differ in their semantic distances.

Interpretation of Cohen's d values:
  <0.2: Negligible effect
  0.2-0.5: Small effect
  0.5-0.8: Medium effect
  >0.8: Large effect

Results sorted by effect size magnitude (largest first):

Fully Non-Gendered vs. Minimal-Gendered:
  Cohen's d: 0.8748 (Large effect)
  Cross-system mean distance: 0.0322 (n=7)
  Within-system mean distance: 0.0506 (n=21)
  Difference: -0.0184

Dual-Gendered vs. Minimal-Gendered:
  Cohen's d: 0.7005 (Medium effect)
  Cross-system mean distance: 0.0425 (n=10)
  Within-system mean distance: 0.0574 (n=45)
  Difference: -0.0149

Minimal-Gendered vs. Tri-Gendered:
  Cohen's d: 0.6340 (Medium effect)
  Cross-system mean distance: 0.0384 (n=5)
